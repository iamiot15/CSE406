# CSE406
This laboratory assignment focuses on developing a complete IoT solution for water level monitoring. The system reads analog signals from a water level sensor, processes the raw data through calibration and mapping algorithms, implements intelligent threshold-based alerting, and calculates real-time rate of change to predict water level trends.
